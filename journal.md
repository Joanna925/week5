from this week's work I found that converting text into data and tell the story in another form makes the plots clearer as well as more insteresting to look at. For example when I was using knightlab to tell a story of origins and history of Jewish from 3000 years ago, I found that first of all it is more clear when i categorize the sotry based on the location and making story in each location nice and short helps to make the entire story less boring and more informative. I let my roomate who hates long boring history stories view my work on knightlab and let her play around with the tool as well, suprisingly she did noy find it boring and was able to learn the story from it. With Inkscape, it is easier for readers to catch the highlight and the important points of the story and it let the author make the point of the story easier than writting it down in an essay form. It makes the story visually appealing, which, is visual learner friendly, and it also fits to webpage better than texts. For those who do not have background knowledeg about the story, it better to tell the story by making it visually appealing or in point form with mapping on the side. When I let my roomate read the story, she can tell what I am trying to emphasize and where the story is going. the tools are making story telling more efficent, less boring, and it does not require much background knowlege to understand the story, which, enlarges the targeted group of readers.
